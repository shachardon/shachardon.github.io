Hi, I'm Shachar.

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, exploring the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), under the supervision of Prof. [Omri Abend](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend/).
Iâ€™m interested in quality estimation, dialogues and interaction -- between a person and a model, or even between two models.

In addition, I am a research intern at IBM Research, working on collaboratively pretraining by recycling finetuned models.
